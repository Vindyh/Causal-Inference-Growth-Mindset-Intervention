Section 2.1 of this paper focuses on exploratory data analysis, while section 2.2 explores average treat-
ment eâ€€ect estimation using four main approaches: Outcome Regression (OR) Estimator approach, Inverse

approach. Section 2.3 of the paper discusses a novel approach known as `Causal Forests' aimed at address-
ing issues related to clustered observations and selection bias.
